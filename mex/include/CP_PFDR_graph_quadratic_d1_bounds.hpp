 *       F(x) = 1/2 ||y - A x||^2 + ||x||_{d1,La_d1} + ||x||_{l1,La_l1}

 *
 * It is easy to introduce a SDP metric weighting the squared l2-norm
 * between y and A x. Indeed, if M is the matrix of such a SDP metric,
 *   ||y - A x||_M^2 = ||Dy - D A x||^2, with D = M^(1/2).
 * Thus, it is sufficient to call the method with Y <- Dy, and A <- D A.
 * Moreover, when A is the identity and M is diagonal (weighted l2 distance
 * between x and y), one should call on the precomposed version 
 * (N set to zero, see below) with Y <- DDy = My and A <- D2 = M.
 *
 * Parallel implementation with OpenMP API.

 * nonsmooth functionals regularized by graph total variation, in preparation.

 *              is performed if relative changes of X (in Euclidean norm) is less

 *              temporarily draw minimizer away from solution, and give bad
